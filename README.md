## 🧠 Project Overview  
This project provides an in-depth analysis of global economic indicators from 1960 to 2020 using World Bank datasets. It focuses on GDP trends, Human Development Index, life expectancy, and electric power consumption across continents.  
The goal is to understand how regions have grown, identify development gaps, and uncover the key factors driving global economic progress.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective  
This analysis aims to support important global economic questions such as:  
- Which regions contribute the most to global GDP?  
- What factors influence life expectancy and human development?  
- How do developing nations compare against developed economies?  
- How does power consumption relate to GDP and overall quality of life?  

These findings can help policymakers, economists, and global development organizations make data-driven decisions.

## 📈 Key Insights  

- **North America & Europe generate nearly 75% of the world's GDP**, driven by advanced industrialization and high productivity.  
- **East Asia & Pacific show exponential GDP growth after 2018**, primarily due to China and Japan’s tech-driven rise.  
- **Middle East shows strong GDP growth after 2000**, fueled by the rapid economic development of Arab countries.  
- **Higher GDP per capita correlates with longer life expectancy**, highlighting the wealth–health connection.  
- **Developing countries improving economically could significantly raise global life expectancy and reduce inequality.**  
- **Electric power consumption is a major driver of GDP growth**, showing the importance of energy accessibility.  
- **HDI is a strong measure of living standards**, influenced by life expectancy, education, and GDP per capita.  
- **Developing regions are catching up in the 21st century**, narrowing the gap with North America and Europe.

## ✅ Conclusion & Recommendations  

### **Conclusions**
- Economic inequality across regions is significant, with developed economies dominating global GDP.  
- HDI, GDP per capita, and life expectancy strongly correlate, emphasizing how economic growth improves quality of life.  
- Asia and the Middle East show rapid economic progress, reshaping global economic dynamics.

### **Recommendations**
- **Invest in electricity and energy infrastructure** to fuel productivity.  
- **Improve health and education systems** to raise HDI and long-term economic output.  
- **Support developing nations** through partnerships, technology transfer, and sustainable investments.  
- **Encourage balanced global growth**, ensuring that economic development leads to improved living standards worldwide.
